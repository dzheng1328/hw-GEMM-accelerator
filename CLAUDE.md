# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project status

This repo is currently a scaffold: only `README.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/learnings.md`, and a
`gitignore` exist. None of the `rtl/`, `tb/`, `model/`, or `sim/` directories described below have been
created yet. There are no build/lint/test commands to run yet — once RTL, testbenches, or model scripts
are added, this file should be updated with the actual commands (e.g. `cocotb` test invocation, Icarus/
Verilator simulation commands, PyTorch training script usage).

## What this is

A systolic-array-based hardware accelerator (Verilog, verified via cocotb simulation) that classifies
MNIST digits using a real trained neural network. It's a portfolio project for RTL/logic design
internship recruiting — the goal is a working, verifiable hardware design, not a production product.

## Planned repo layout

```
rtl/          Verilog source
tb/           cocotb testbenches
model/        PyTorch training + quantization scripts
sim/          simulation build artifacts (gitignored)
docs/         learnings log, design decisions
```

## Toolchain

| Tool | Role |
|---|---|
| Verilog | hardware description language — the design itself |
| Icarus Verilog / Verilator | simulate the design |
| cocotb | Python-based testbenches |
| GTKWave | waveform viewing / debugging |
| PyTorch | train + quantize the reference model |
| Yosys | synthesis to gate-level netlist |
| OpenLane | physical design / layout (Phase 3) |

## Phases

- **Phase 1 — core deliverable**: a single verified 8x8 systolic array tile, running real MNIST
  classification, with a cocotb testbench.
- **Phase 2 — scale up**: multiple tiles connected by a simple network-on-chip (NoC), plus Yosys
  synthesis for real area/timing numbers.
- **Phase 3 — stretch goal**: full OpenLane physical design flow, possible Tiny Tapeout submission.

Know which phase current work belongs to — Phase 1 work should stay scoped to a single tile plus its
testbench, not anticipate NoC or synthesis concerns.

## Docs workflow

Two logs in `docs/` are part of the working process, not just reference material:

- `docs/decisions.md` — log architectural decisions as they're made (context, options considered,
  decision, why). Add an entry whenever a non-trivial design choice is made.
- `docs/learnings.md` — log real problems hit and how they were solved (phase, problem, cause, fix,
  takeaway). Add an entry whenever something breaks or takes longer than expected. Quick scratch notes
  can live elsewhere and get distilled into an entry here once the problem is actually resolved.

Both files use a template at the top and add new entries most-recent-first below the `<!-- Entries
below, most recent first -->` marker.
